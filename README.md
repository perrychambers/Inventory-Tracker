# Markdown Software Engineering

This folder contains standard templates for software engineering written in Markdown. The Requirements Analysis Document and Software Design Documents are stored in a KabukiPress tree structure because it speeds up Markdown rendering, it helps block out distractions, and it's more programmer-friendly.

## Organization

 The directions for how to use the templates are stored in the [Astartup™ Cookbook](https://github.com/AStarStartup/AstartupCookbook/tree/master/GettingStarted/Markdown). There are different Markdown templates for different tasks:

* Markdown Software Engineering
* [Markdown Game Design](https://github.com/KabukiStarship/MarkdownGameDev)
* [Markdown Cookbook](https://github.com/KabukiStarship/MarkdownCookbook)

## Mission and Vision

The mission of Markdown Software Engineering is to help you start out or get your project onto the right foot and increase productivity with Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) documentation. Our vision is to automate as much documentation as possible with [KabukiPress](https://github.com/KabukiStarship/KabukiPress).

## MVP RoadMap

***When you're first starting out your project, your roadmap should be here in the root `readme` file because people have very low tolerance for non-working code, they will just move on in search of the easy thing and you can't blame them, so if you're trying to woo contributors, you must do it with your Mission and vision, then immediately after show the action plan that someone else things is a good idea achievable, and worth their time to contribute too.***

We can achieve a Minimum Viable Product by completing the following project phases:

1. Foo - In this phase we will say hello world.
1. Bar - In this phase we will say Foo and Bar.

This is a good idea because foo and bar are both common names for abstract functions.
